## About. 
In this repository, I will attach documents that will demonstrate the skill I have acquired.

Some Skills Include. 
* Junit testing.
* Unit testing. 
* Assertions.
* Code analysis. 
 
## Course reflection.:mag_right: 
* To briefly summarize The contact classes were developed to create two methods one to create contact objects and the other to handle contact objects, then I developed code that would test each unit in the method to verify and validate that it operates based on requirements.

<h5> How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?</h5>

* I can make sure that the code or program is both functional and secure by using unit tests. This involves creating tests that follow the specified requirements to ensure accurate functionality. With unit tests, I can verify that the functions created produce the expected outcomes that match the requirements. This process helps me guarantee that my code works correctly and is safe to use.

<h5> How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?</h5>

* To understand the user's needs, I begin by analyzing their requests and identifying the desired output and outcomes. Once I have a clear picture of what's expected, I start incorporating tests into the program. These tests help me ensure that the user's requirements are met by verifying the accuracy of the desired outcomes. This approach helps me align the program with the user's needs effectively.

<h5>How do I approach designing software?</h5>

* In my software design approach, I follow the processes from the Agile Manifesto, including methodologies like Scrum. This approach emphasizes iterative development and collaboration. Looking back to the concepts that I've learned in this class, I'll integrate testing in the early stages of the project. This proves to be cost-effective and significantly reduces the time required for "design to deployment". By developing tests alongside the software itself, I ensure a smoother workflow and fewer bugs at release. This proactive testing approach aligns with the agile philosophy and contributes to more efficient work and a higher quality end product.
