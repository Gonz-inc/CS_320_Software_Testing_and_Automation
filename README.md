# CS-320 Software Test Automation
Gerardo Gonzalez.
Southern New Hampshire University. 

## About. 
In this repository, I will attach documents that will demonstrate the skill I have acquired.

Some Skills Include. 
* Junit testing.
* Unit testing. 
* Assertions.
* Code analysis. 
 
## Course reflection.:mag_right: 
* To briefly summarize The contact classes were developed to create two methods one to create contact objects and the other to handle contact objects, then I developed code that would test each unit in the method to verify and validate that it operates based on requirements.
<p>

*How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
<p>

* If I could revise one part of these documents I would improve the Business Application document by simplifying all the data diagrams and system requirements. 
<p>

* I interpreted the user's needs by creating diagrams of what they wanted in their system and prioritizing different parts of the system according to what was wanted most important to them as well as setting up limitations on what can be developed during the initial planning and design cycle. It's important they consider the needs of the client when designing a system because it shows business integrity which will lead to higher satisfaction with the end product.
<p>

* During the integration cycle code would be developed by taking the initial approach with an agile methodology. One approach I took was using Class UML diagrams which help create a comparison and focal point for the developers to create functions and methods that will meet the client's needs. Using this approach in the future will help me by having the diagrams server as a blueprint which helps start the initial process during an agile sprint.
